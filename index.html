    <h1>Introduction<br></h1>
  <p>I'm a front end web developer. I love spending time with friends and family and watching lots of movies. I love the internet and I'm excited to develop content on it. I am eager to learn as much as I can so I can turn my knowledge into a career in web development.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>When I'm not working in web development, I like to hang out with my Basset Hound, Mavis. She is ridiculously cute.</p>

  <h1> Where I'm From </h1>
  <p>I hail from the great state of Michigan, though I moved to Minnesota, where I live today, when I was just 9 years old. I love it in Minneapolis and couldn't imagine living anywhere else. That is until it's January and 50 below zero and then I pretty much want to move to Hawaii and never look back.
  <br>
  <br>
  I love it in Minneapolis because it's just big enough to keep me constantly entertained, but still small enough that I don't get lost or overwhelmed here.</p>
